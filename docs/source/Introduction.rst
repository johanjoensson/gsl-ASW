Introduction

The goal of this project is to make my own DFT code, using the Augmented
Spherical Wave basis functions. My implementation is based on what is described
in the book “The augmented spherical wave method: A comprehensive treatment” by
V. Eyert, Springer verlag 2013. For exchange-correlation functionals I am using
the `XCFun library, <http://dftlibs.org/xcfun/>`_.

Progress is slow, and this is very much a hobby project of mine.
