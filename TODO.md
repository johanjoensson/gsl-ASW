# Semisorted list of stuff to get done (loss of detail in later parts)
1. Radial integrals of basis functions
1. Hamiltonian matrix elements
1. Ovelap matrix elements
1. Solve matrix equation to get eigenvalues
1. Calculate DoS from eigenvalues
1. Set up/update electron density
1. Set up/update potential
1. Calculate total energies

# Kinda done
1. XC-potential (using the xcfun library) (LDA only atm)

# Definitely done
1. Off center potential contributoins for initial potential
